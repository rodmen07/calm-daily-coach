# Focus (Calm Daily Coach) - Product Roadmap

Canonical forward roadmap, last audited against real git/gh state 2026-07-20. This
document supersedes the forward-looking sections of docs/FRONTEND_FUNCTIONALITY_PLAN.md,
docs/AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, and docs/MONETIZATION_PLAN.md; those files remain
as historical records with status banners.

## Direction (user, 2026-07-19)

Development focus is **frontend, UI, and UX**. Backend-leaning work (Stripe webhooks,
entitlement server logic) is explicitly deprioritized until the user redirects; see the
v0.5 entry below. This applies to every milestone in this document, not just the one it
is written next to.

## Versioning convention

- Delivery is PR-based: releases are tracked by merged PR number on `main`, deployed
  automatically to GitHub Pages. There are no git tags.
- package.json has stayed at 0.1.0 since the project started. Starting with the roadmap
  consolidation PR, package.json is bumped once per shipped milestone, targeting roughly
  one minor version per week. In practice this has not been a strict 1:1 sequence: v0.3
  (reminder delivery, PRs #80-#81) shipped without its own bump, so package.json stayed
  at 0.2.0 through v0.3 and moved directly to 0.4.0 when v0.4 shipped. Treat "one bump
  per shipped feature milestone" as the rule, not "every integer gets used."
- Milestones below are sized so each ships as one or two small PRs, matching the
  autonomous one-increment-per-run dev workflow.

## Product rules (non-negotiable, apply to every milestone)

- No infinite feed.
- No streak pressure (streak mechanics were deliberately removed in PR #73).
- Daily dose cap stays enforced.
- Calm, ADHD friendly UX: opt-in nudges only, no guilt or escalation mechanics.

## Current state (2026-07-20)

- App: "Focus: Your ADHD friendly self-improvement coach" (rebranded from Calm Daily
  Coach in PR #59). Next.js 16 / React 19 TypeScript static export on GitHub Pages at
  https://rodmen07.github.io/calm-daily-coach/. No server routes.
- Persistence: since the v0.4 flip (2026-07-19), an unset
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKIN_BACKEND` resolves to Firestore for signed-in users on
  Firebase-configured deployments and to localStorage otherwise; explicit
  `local|firestore` values still force their mode. Automatic local fallback and
  idempotent guest-to-account migration are unchanged. Signed-out and
  Firebase-less usage stays localStorage-only. Gratitude journal entries (v0.7)
  gained the same adapter in v0.9 (PR #89, hardened in PR #90): the code path
  for signed-in, Firebase-configured sync exists and is tested, reusing this
  same resolution policy with no separate toggle. Live behavior is still
  local-fallback for every real user today because the updated Firestore rules
  have not been published in the console yet (USER-ONLY, see below); once
  published, journal entries sync exactly like check-ins do.
- Monetization: single $5/month membership after a 30-day free trial. Stripe Payment
  Link billing scaffolding shipped in PR #77 (src/lib/billing.ts,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`, `client_reference_id` plus `prefilled_email`
  attribution, mailto fallback). Entitlement flips are manual in Firestore for now, and
  automating that flip (v0.5) is deprioritized per the direction above.
- Quality gate: PR #86 (2026-07-19) consolidated CI into a single required job (lint,
  typecheck, tests, build) so the branch-protection check now actually gates all of
  them; it previously gated only lint and build.
- Accessibility: PR #87 (2026-07-20, v0.8) added a global focus-visible ring, a
  skip-to-content link, a reduced-motion reset that covers every animated surface (it
  had previously only covered some), a single layout `<main>` landmark, aria-current
  navigation, and fixed an icon-only checkbox with no accessible name.
- PRs #69 through #77 all merged on 2026-07-18 (highest number is #77; the final merge
  to main that day was #76): automation PR reliability (#69), dev-agent backlog
  hygiene (#70), ReminderSettingsPanel (#71), sync-badge backend-mode fix (#72),
  challenges de-streaking (#73), week-over-week review insight (#74), postcss audit
  override with npm audit now clean (#75), dashboard AffirmationCard (#76), Stripe
  Payment Link (#77).
- All six items of the frontend functionality plan (action rail, onboarding, weekly
  insights, plan editor, browser reminders, offline/sync status) are complete as of
  2026-07-18.
- The repo also hosts a Python dev-agent pipeline in agents/dev-agent/ (backlog ids
  cdc-001 through cdc-016). Roadmap items may reference cdc ids, but files under
  agents/dev-agent/ must never be edited by roadmap work.

## Next milestones

### v0.2 - Roadmap consolidation and reminder delivery design (target week of 2026-07-25)

Resets the paper trail to reality and unblocks v0.3 and v0.5 with the design decisions
they wait on. All items agent-doable now.

- This document plus status banners on the three legacy planning docs and a one-line
  README pointer (1 PR). Bump package.json to 0.2.0 in the same PR and keep the
  versioning convention stated above.
- Reminder scheduling design doc: enumerate GitHub Actions cron plus email, client-side
  Web Notifications, and Firebase Functions options with cost, privacy, and calm-UX
  tradeoffs; ship as a docs-only PR for user review (1 PR).
- Done when: ROADMAP.md and banners are merged, package.json reads 0.2.0, and the
  reminder design doc is merged and awaiting user sign-off.

### v0.3 - Reminder delivery v1 (target week of 2026-08-01)

BLOCKED until the v0.2 reminder design doc merges with user sign-off.

- Design doc under review: [docs/design/REMINDER_SCHEDULING.md](design/REMINDER_SCHEDULING.md) scores the delivery options and proposes the phased plan this milestone implements.
- BLOCKED (design approval): implement the approved delivery mechanism (for example
  Web Notifications opt-in nudges that fire with the tab backgrounded, or a GitHub
  Actions cron email digest) behind the existing ReminderSettingsPanel channel choice
  (1 to 2 PRs).
- Keep the "nothing is sent automatically" copy truthful: update copy, README, and
  reminder tests to match the shipped behavior exactly.
- Product rules apply: reminders stay opt-in, single daily nudge, no escalation or
  guilt mechanics.
- Done when: an opted-in user receives exactly one daily nudge via the chosen channel
  and all reminder copy matches actual behavior.

### v0.4 - Sync by default: Firestore flip with safe fallback (target week of 2026-08-08)

The adapter, migration, and honest sync badge (PR #72) already exist, so the flip is
small and testable. Agent-doable now, except the listed USER-ONLY item.

Status (2026-07-19): agent-side work implemented; awaiting the USER-ONLY items below.

- DONE (2026-07-19): flipped the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKIN_BACKEND` default with a safe
  resolution matrix (unset resolves to `firestore` only when Firebase config is
  present AND the user is signed in, `local` otherwise; explicit `local` still forces
  local), kept the existing automatic local fallback, and added migration notes plus
  a rollback lever (repository variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKIN_BACKEND=local`, inlined
  by deploy-pages.yml) to the README.
- DONE (2026-07-19): sync-badge and fallback tests extended for the new default
  (CLOUD SYNCED, SYNC OFF (LOCAL), SIGNED IN (LOCAL) states plus the resolution
  matrix and Firestore write/read/migration fallback paths).
- DONE (2026-07-19): Firestore security rules for `users/{uid}` and
  `users/{uid}/checkins` documented in docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md (docs only;
  deploying the rules in the Firebase console is USER-ONLY).
- USER-ONLY: confirm Firebase project quotas and billing before the default flip goes
  live, and publish the documented security rules in the Firebase console.
- Done when: a fresh deploy defaults to Firestore sync for signed-in users, falls back
  to local cleanly when Firestore is unreachable, and the security rules doc is merged.

### v0.5 - Entitlement: webhook design and client-side membership state (DEPRIORITIZED)

**Status (2026-07-19): DEPRIORITIZED.** The user's frontend/UI-UX direction (see
"Direction" above) explicitly deprioritizes backend-leaning work including this
milestone. The version number 0.5 stays reserved for it; nothing below is scheduled
until the user redirects. This is why the old v0.9 ("paid-value expansion," gated on
this milestone's approval) has been re-slotted; see v0.9 below.

Monetization ladder step 4. The static site cannot receive Stripe webhooks, so
automation needs a design doc first; meanwhile the client can honestly read the
manually-set entitlement.

- Stripe webhook entitlement automation design doc ONLY: Firebase Functions (or
  equivalent) receiver mapping `client_reference_id` to `users/{uid}.subscriptionStatus`,
  with cost estimate and failure modes; docs PR for user review (1 PR).
- Client-side entitlement read: dashboard membership panel reads `subscriptionStatus`
  from `users/{uid}` in Firestore with graceful local fallback and calm expired-state
  copy (1 PR).
- USER-ONLY: create the $5/month Stripe Payment Link and set repository variable
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`.
- USER-ONLY: flip `subscriptionStatus` to "active" in Firestore for real payments until
  webhook automation ships.
- Done when: the design doc is merged for review and the dashboard reflects real
  Firestore entitlement state with calm fallback copy.

### v0.6 - Calm UX polish from the dev-agent backlog (target week of 2026-08-22)

Burns down pending cdc items that fit the product rules, keeping the autonomous
pipeline fed with small well-scoped work. Agent-doable now. Reference cdc ids in PR
bodies but never edit agents/dev-agent/ files.

- DONE (2026-07-19, v0.6 PR1): wired the already-built ProgressRing component
  (cdc-003; cdc-015 was closed as its duplicate) into the dashboard today spotlight.
  It shows today's loop progress only (plan set is halfway, check-in submitted is
  complete), honors prefers-reduced-motion by rendering the final value with no
  fill animation, and keeps the zero state calm and inviting.
- DONE (2026-07-19, v0.6 PR2): keyboard shortcut help modal (cdc-004) plus
  empty-state illustration component (cdc-012). The header "?" button or the ?
  key opens an accessible dialog (focus trap, Escape, reduced-motion aware)
  listing only real shortcuts, including new "g then d/f/e/r" go-to chords that
  never fire while typing. A reusable CalmEmptyState component with hand-drawn
  inline SVG art now covers Execute (no plan), Review (no check-ins), and the
  Slicer history list.
- Backlog hygiene note: the PR #70 hygiene pass already closed cdc-010 (tag filter
  chips) and cdc-016 (scroll-to-top) as duplicates of cdc-007 and cdc-006, which stay
  pending. Skip any infinite-scroll-adjacent items as product-rule violations.
- Done when: both feature PRs are merged with tests and no product rule is violated.

### v0.7 - Gratitude journal (target week of 2026-08-29)

Agent-doable now. A single small PR, matching the one-or-two-PR milestone size.

- DONE (2026-07-19): gratitude journal entry form (cdc-014) at /journal as a
  bounded reflection surface. Entries are keyed by local calendar date so
  exactly one exists per day; after saving, the editor becomes a read view of
  today's entry with a gentle note, and editing updates that same entry in
  place. A soft prompt rotates deterministically by date. History is a finite
  newest-first list revealed in chunks of 7 ("Show earlier entries"), with a
  CalmEmptyState journal variant when empty; no streaks, counters, badges, or
  missed-day mechanics anywhere. Persistence is localStorage-only scoped per
  user (the slicer pattern); Firestore sync is deliberately deferred to
  "Later / candidates" rather than half-wired. Shipped with a header nav link,
  a "g then j" go-to chord listed in the keyboard help modal, and package.json
  bumped to 0.7.0.
- Done when: the journal PR is merged with tests and the surface enforces the
  one-entry-per-day bound.

### v0.8 - Accessibility, focus-state, and reduced-motion pass (DONE)

Scheduled QA-stream audit (see "Standing streams" in the backlog), landed as a
milestone since it touched every interactive surface in the app.

- DONE (2026-07-20, PR #87): global focus-visible ring replacing two ad hoc rules,
  a skip-to-content link, a reduced-motion reset covering every inline Tailwind
  `animate-*`/`transition-*` class (the old block missed the dashboard counters,
  slicer confetti/bounce/ping, breathe pacer, sync-badge pulse, and
  subscription-guard spinner), a single layout `<main id="main-content">` (was 7
  duplicate per-page mains), aria-current navigation via a new `site-nav.tsx`, and a
  real accessibility bug fixed (the slicer step-toggle checkbox had no accessible
  name when unchecked). 249 to 257 tests. package.json bumped to 0.8.0.
- Worth an eyeball live: the subscription-guard spinner freezes under reduced
  motion (expected behavior, but confirm it does not read as stuck).
- Done when: the PR is merged with tests and no new interactive surface regresses
  keyboard reachability or a visible focus state.

### v0.9 - Gratitude journal Firestore sync (DONE)

Re-slotted 2026-07-20: the previously-defined v0.9 ("paid-value expansion design
doc") was gated behind v0.5 entitlement-design approval, which is itself
deprioritized per the direction above with no re-approval date, so it was not a
real next milestone. This replacement has no backend/entitlement dependency: it
extends the same client-side Firestore pattern v0.4 already shipped
(`src/lib/firestore-checkins.ts` calls the `firebase/firestore` client SDK
directly, no server component) to the gratitude journal, which had been
localStorage-only since v0.7 by deliberate, documented choice pending exactly this
work.

Full design, safety argument, scope boundaries, and the candidates considered
against it: [docs/design/JOURNAL_FIRESTORE_SYNC.md](design/JOURNAL_FIRESTORE_SYNC.md).

- DONE (2026-07-20, PR #89): `src/lib/firestore-journal.ts` (client SDK only,
  upsert-by-date-key against `users/{uid}/journal/{entryId}`) plus
  `src/lib/journal-store.ts`, a backend-resolution adapter reusing
  `resolveCheckinBackend` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKIN_BACKEND` directly (no new env
  var), with local / firestore / firestore-fallback semantics mirroring
  `checkin-store.ts`. `docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md` gained the
  `users/{uid}/journal/{entryId}` match block (owner-only read/create/update,
  delete denied). `src/app/journal/page.tsx` was rewired to create its store
  via `createJournalStore` and route load/save through the async adapter
  (a pre-merge verification pass found the adapter had been built but never
  wired into the page, and the fix landed in the same PR before merge).
  package.json bumped to 0.9.0.
- DONE (2026-07-20, PR #90, QA hardening pass): added the missing
  firestore-fallback test coverage, fixed a stale module docstring, and added
  a malformed-document field-presence check to `listFirestoreJournalEntries`
  (dates/text validated before use, matching `firestore-checkins.ts`'s
  existing pattern) with a new direct-SDK-mock test file proving the skip.
  261 to 267 tests total.
- Guest-to-account journal migration stayed explicitly out of scope, matching
  the design doc.
- USER-ONLY, does not block anything already merged: publishing the updated
  ruleset in the Firebase console is still outstanding. Until then, journal
  writes hit the currently-live rules (no journal match block yet), and the
  adapter's fallback-on-error path keeps entries on localStorage exactly as
  they behave today - no data loss, no visible breakage.
- Done when: the adapter and resolution tests pass (mirroring
  `checkin-store.test.ts`'s coverage of local/firestore/fallback/override), the
  rules doc is updated, and `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and
  `npm run build` are green on the quality-gate check. **Confirmed met**: all
  four conditions verified green on PR #89 and re-verified on PR #90.

### v0.10 - Theme consistency: close light/dark rendering gaps + regression guard (agent-doable now)

Defined 2026-07-20 (product-role increment) after auditing the backlog's
unscheduled candidates - a performance pass, general polish, Playwright E2E -
and finding none of them milestone-shaped as worded (see the design doc's
section 1 for why each was set aside). Reading the app's actual theming
architecture (`globals.css` plus every route's real markup) against itself
found real, currently-shipped light/dark rendering defects instead of a
hypothetical polish target.

Full audit, technical plan, and done-when:
[docs/design/THEME_CONSISTENCY.md](design/THEME_CONSISTENCY.md). Every choice
in that document is an explicitly flagged, overridable default, not a hard
review gate.

- Fix three `hover:bg-slate-800` occurrences (`ambient/page.tsx`,
  `breathe/page.tsx` x2, `challenges/page.tsx`) that read fine in dark mode
  but produce near-invisible dark-on-dark hover contrast in light mode.
- Resolve `subscription-guard.tsx`'s fixed-dark paywall screen one way or the
  other (default: make it theme-aware using the app's existing tokens;
  overridable: keep it deliberately fixed-dark as a recorded decision) - the
  one genuine product call in this milestone.
- Fix `focus/page.tsx`'s hardcoded `bg-white/70` callout nested in an
  otherwise theme-token-driven card.
- Add a regression-guard test that reads the app's literal color-class usage
  and `globals.css`'s override allowlist as two sources that must agree, so a
  future page can't silently ship broken in one theme the way these three did.
- Explicitly out of scope for v0.10 (keeps this a small, well-scoped
  milestone): migrating the ~70 already-covered `text-slate-700`-style
  literals to the `--token` system wholesale. They render correctly in both
  themes today via the existing override list; that's a nice-to-have
  cleanup, not a currently-broken surface.
- Done when: all three named fixes land, the new guard test exists and is
  verified to actually fail against the pre-fix state, and `npm run lint`,
  `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` are green on the
  quality-gate check. package.json bumps to 0.10.0 in the implementation PR,
  not in this definition.

## Later / candidates (unscheduled)

Valid direction from AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phases 4 to 6 and the
monetization ladder, plus housekeeping. Nothing here is scheduled until v0.2 through
v0.10 land.

- Performance pass: bundle analysis, web-vitals instrumentation, Firebase SDK load
  optimization (AUTONOMOUS plan Phase 4).
- Security hardening: replace the untouched template SECURITY.md with a real policy,
  secret scanning, dependency review (AUTONOMOUS plan Phase 5).
- Playwright E2E smoke test for the daily loop plus a PR template (AUTONOMOUS plan
  Phase 6).
- Remove the dead reminder-email helper src/lib/mailer.ts plus its nodemailer
  dependency once the reminder design settles: no other module imports it, and the
  static export has no server routes to run it.
- Paid value expansion (advanced weekly narratives, cloud restore): deferred until
  entitlement automation ships.
- ~~checkinStatus dashboard persistence (LOW bug)~~: FIXED via PR #90
  (2026-07-20). The ProgressRing no longer resets to 50 percent on reload; a
  `checkedIn` field on `SavedPlannerState` now persists and rehydrates the
  same 100 percent check-in state through the existing localStorage blob.
  Considered and set aside for v0.9 proper in favor of journal sync, then
  picked up as a standalone QA-stream fix instead, exactly as this entry
  originally anticipated.
- ~~Gratitude journal cloud sync~~: promoted out of this list into v0.9 above
  (2026-07-20); no longer just a candidate.

## Blocked and user-only summary

Blocked (with reasons):

- Reminder delivery v1 (v0.3): blocked on the v0.2 design doc being approved by the
  user; a static GitHub Pages site cannot run background schedulers itself.
- Stripe webhook entitlement implementation: blocked on the v0.5 design doc approval
  and on the user provisioning Firebase Functions billing; a static site cannot
  receive webhooks. As of 2026-07-19, v0.5 itself is deprioritized per the user's
  frontend/UI-UX direction, so this has no active target date at all right now.
- Rust coach bridge deployment (`NEXT_PUBLIC_RUST_COACH_BRIDGE_URL`): blocked; no
  backend exists to host it. The portfolio GCP/Fly infrastructure was decommissioned
  to zero on 2026-06-04 with all runtime data gone, so any idea that assumed reusing
  that infrastructure stays blocked until something is redeployed. This repo itself
  (GitHub Pages plus Firebase) is unaffected.

User-only (paid-account and console actions an agent must not perform):

- Create the $5/month Stripe Payment Link and set the repository variable
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`.
- Flip `subscriptionStatus` to "active" in Firestore for real paying users until
  webhook automation ships.
- Deploy Firestore security rules in the Firebase console (ruleset documented in
  docs/FIRESTORE_RULES.md).
- Confirm Firebase quotas and billing before the v0.4 default flip.

## History and supersession

- docs/FRONTEND_FUNCTIONALITY_PLAN.md: all six priority items shipped; weekly
  insights, browser reminders, and offline/sync status landed on 2026-07-18. The doc
  is now a historical completion log. Its "start with the dashboard action rail"
  starting point shipped long ago.
- docs/AUTONOMOUS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: Phases 1 to 3 are done except Phase 3
  item 4 (server-side scheduled reminders), which became the v0.2/v0.3 reminder
  design work; Phases 4 to 6 are folded into "Later / candidates" above. Its progress
  log stops at 2026-06-27 and misses everything from PR #52 onward, including ambient
  audio (PR #52), micro challenges (PR #53), guided breathwork (PR #56), the Focus rebrand
  (PR #59), the ADHD Task Slicer (PR #61), and the dev-agent automation platform
  (PRs #63 through #70).
- docs/MONETIZATION_PLAN.md: the single $5/month membership (header updated 2026-07-18)
  replaced the Free/Pro/Team feature-gate and Starter/Pro/Team metrics framework;
  those sections are retired. Ladder steps 4 and 5 (entitlement controls, paid value
  expansion) carry forward as v0.5 and "Later / candidates".
- Challenge streaks shipped in PR #53 were deliberately removed in PR #73 to honor the
  no-streak-pressure promise; any roadmap item implying streaks is off-limits.
- 2026-07-20 roadmap audit (product-role increment): this document had no v0.8 section
  at all despite v0.8 (PR #87, accessibility pass) being merged and package.json reading
  0.8.0, and it did not mention the 2026-07-19 frontend-direction memo anywhere, so a
  reader could not tell v0.5 was deprioritized from this file alone. Both are corrected
  above. The backlog's v0.9 ("paid-value expansion," gated on v0.5 approval) was also
  found to be stuck behind a deprioritized dependency with no re-approval date; v0.9 is
  re-slotted to gratitude journal Firestore sync (see v0.9 above and
  [docs/design/JOURNAL_FIRESTORE_SYNC.md](design/JOURNAL_FIRESTORE_SYNC.md)), and paid-value
  expansion remains valid future direction under "Later / candidates," unchanged.
- 2026-07-20 roadmap re-audit (product-role increment, second pass same day):
  verified PRs #88, #89, and #90 (roadmap audit, journal sync implementation,
  and its QA hardening) via `gh pr view --json mergedAt,mergeCommit` before
  writing anything, then found this document still described the gratitude
  journal as "localStorage-only" in the Current state section and still
  carried v0.9's done-when as an open checklist despite both PRs being merged
  and package.json reading 0.9.0 - both corrected above. Also found the
  "Later / candidates" checkinStatus bug entry stale in the other direction:
  it described the bug as unfixed and deferred, when PR #90 (same day) had
  already fixed it; struck through and marked FIXED. v0.10 (theme
  consistency) defined below and in
  [docs/design/THEME_CONSISTENCY.md](design/THEME_CONSISTENCY.md) after
  auditing the unscheduled candidates and finding none milestone-shaped as
  worded; the audit that produced v0.10 read the app's real component code
  and CSS rather than proposing polish in the abstract.
