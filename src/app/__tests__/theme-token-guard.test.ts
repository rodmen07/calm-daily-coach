/**
 * Theme-token drift guard (v0.10 theme consistency pass).
 *
 * docs/design/THEME_CONSISTENCY.md audited the app's real component markup
 * against its own CSS-variable theming system and found three shipped
 * light/dark rendering defects, each a literal (non-token) Tailwind color
 * class that slipped past the theme system unnoticed:
 *   1. `hover:bg-slate-800` on four back/reset nav buttons (ambient, breathe
 *      x2, challenges) paired with the theme-aware `text-[--foreground]`
 *      token - fine in dark mode, near-invisible dark-on-dark hover text the
 *      moment a user switches to light mode.
 *   2. subscription-guard.tsx's paywall screens, fully hardcoded dark
 *      regardless of the user's chosen theme.
 *   3. focus/page.tsx's `bg-white/70` "Coach brief" callout, a bright white
 *      box floating inside an otherwise dark-themed panel.
 *
 * All three shipped and went unnoticed because nothing scanned for the
 * pattern. This test is that scan, run over every .tsx file under src/app -
 * not just the three files this milestone happened to name - so a FOURTH
 * such defect fails CI before it ships instead of waiting for the next
 * audit to notice it by hand.
 *
 * Mechanism (Source A / Source B, THEME_CONSISTENCY.md section 3):
 *   Source A: every literal `(bg|text|border)-(slate|gray|zinc|neutral|
 *     stone)-(500-950)` class, with an optional `hover:` prefix and an
 *     optional `/NN` opacity suffix, plus bare bg-white/text-white/bg-black/
 *     text-black - across every src/app/**\/*.tsx file, __tests__ excluded.
 *   Source B, i.e. what makes an occurrence NOT a violation:
 *     (1) the class is covered by globals.css's hand-maintained
 *         `html[data-theme="dark"] .foo { ... }` override block. Parsed live
 *         from the real file rather than hand-copied, so a class added to
 *         the override later is automatically covered here too and this
 *         test can never silently drift from the real coverage list.
 *     (2) the file+class pair is in INTENTIONAL_EXCEPTIONS: a deliberate,
 *         recorded design decision (not debt), each with its reasoning
 *         written down so a reviewer can tell "on purpose" from "forgot".
 *     (3) the file+class pair's count is at or below its ceiling in
 *         BASELINE_DEBT: literal-color usages that predate this milestone
 *         and are explicitly out of scope for it (section 3, "Explicitly
 *         out of scope for v0.10" - migrating the already-covered
 *         text-slate-700-style literals wholesale). This is a FROZEN
 *         CEILING, not a blanket exemption for the file: a new occurrence
 *         of an already-listed class (raising the count above its ceiling),
 *         or any class in that file not listed at all, still fails.
 *
 * Fixing a baselined occurrence should delete or lower its entry in the
 * same change, the same discipline the design doc asks of Fix 1-3 above -
 * otherwise the ceiling quietly stops meaning anything.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a fourth mechanism: THEME_CONSISTENCY.md section 3 named
 * "an explicit `dark:` pair in the same class string" as a way a Source A
 * occurrence could be considered covered. This guard does not implement
 * that, on purpose, and post-merge review (2026-07-20) confirmed why it
 * would be unsound to add: this app's Tailwind `dark:` variant is the
 * library default, tracking the OS-level `prefers-color-scheme` media query
 * (no `@custom-variant dark` remap exists anywhere in globals.css or
 * postcss.config.mjs) - it does NOT track `html[data-theme]`, the attribute
 * `ThemeToggle` actually flips. A user can run this app in light mode on a
 * dark-OS device (or the reverse), so a `dark:foo-500` class pairing proves
 * nothing about whether `foo-500` is safe under the app's own toggle; the
 * two are independent signals. Concretely: every `dark:`-paired risky class
 * already in this tree (verified 2026-07-20 - `page.tsx`'s
 * `dark:border-slate-800` and `dark:bg-slate-900/40`, `pricing/page.tsx`'s
 * two `dark:border-slate-800`, `review/page.tsx`'s `dark:text-slate-800`)
 * is scanned and accounted for the same as any other occurrence, via
 * COVERED_CLASSES or BASELINE_DEBT - never via a `dark:`-pair bypass, because
 * there is none. The synthetic test at the bottom of this file proves a new
 * `dark:`-paired class would be flagged, not silently waved through, so this
 * stays true even if someone adds Source A occurrences.
