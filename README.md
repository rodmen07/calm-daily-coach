# Focus: Your ADHD friendly self-improvement coach

A deliberate, ADHD friendly self-improvement app where users choose a daily content dose and receive exactly that amount.

Live site: https://rodmen07.github.io/calm-daily-coach/

Core principles:

- No infinite feed.
- No streak pressure.
- Daily cap message once the selected dose is completed.

## Implemented in this first slice

- Mobile-first daily plan flow in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Plan and rule definitions in [src/lib/plan.ts](src/lib/plan.ts)

## Added in this second slice

- Persistent check-in storage in [src/lib/browser-checkins.ts](src/lib/browser-checkins.ts)
- Completion and skip controls plus weekly stats UI in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Animated flow-state chips and celebratory completion feedback in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Explicit daily workflow stepper (Focus -> Plan -> Do -> Review) in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Hard step locks that prevent plan edits/regeneration until a daily check-in is submitted in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Animated weekly and focus progress feedback in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Reduced-motion fallbacks for animated feedback in [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css)
- Animated count-up values for weekly summary totals in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Staggered reveal motion for weekly summary cards and focus breakdown rows in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Expanded improvement categories and 5/15/30-minute activity windows in [src/lib/plan.ts](src/lib/plan.ts)
- Added Career, Creativity, and Home focus areas, with the full focus list now kept alphabetical in [src/lib/plan.ts](src/lib/plan.ts)
- Visible improvement category chips in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Route-based multi-page UX flow for Focus, Execute, and Review in [src/app/focus/page.tsx](src/app/focus/page.tsx), [src/app/execute/page.tsx](src/app/execute/page.tsx), and [src/app/review/page.tsx](src/app/review/page.tsx)
- Shared top-level route navigation shell in [src/app/layout.tsx](src/app/layout.tsx) and [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css)
- Dark-mode-first theme system with a persisted light/dark toggle in [src/app/layout.tsx](src/app/layout.tsx), [src/app/components/theme-toggle.tsx](src/app/components/theme-toggle.tsx), and [src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css)
- Switching to light mode now uses an inline confirmation panel so dark mode stays the default experience.
- Shared navigation and card chrome now track the active theme instead of keeping hardcoded light-only surfaces.
- Swipe-enabled step cards with left/right gesture navigation and arrow-key fallback in [src/app/components/swipe-step-card.tsx](src/app/components/swipe-step-card.tsx)
- Swipe-enabled step cards now expose explicit accessible labels and contextual swipe hints in [src/app/components/swipe-step-card.tsx](src/app/components/swipe-step-card.tsx)
- Dashboard now focuses on user metrics and cycle entry only, while step cards carry the primary progression and loop back to dashboard reflection in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Added monetization entry points with a dashboard Pro upsell panel and dedicated pricing route in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx), [src/app/pricing/page.tsx](src/app/pricing/page.tsx), and [src/app/layout.tsx](src/app/layout.tsx)
- Added local monetization telemetry with plan-interest persistence and CTA click tracking in [src/lib/monetization.ts](src/lib/monetization.ts) and [src/app/hooks/use-monetization.ts](src/app/hooks/use-monetization.ts)
- Added an in-app monetization analytics route for local conversion snapshots in [src/app/monetization/page.tsx](src/app/monetization/page.tsx)
- Added a calm daily affirmation card on the dashboard with deterministic date-based rotation and a refresh action in [src/app/components/AffirmationCard.tsx](src/app/components/AffirmationCard.tsx) and [src/lib/affirmations.ts](src/lib/affirmations.ts)

## Added Google login

- Firebase Google Authentication integration in [src/lib/firebase.ts](src/lib/firebase.ts)
- Sign-in and sign-out controls in [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx)
- Local data scoping by signed-in user id to avoid cross-user state on shared devices

## GitHub Pages deployment mode

- This app is configured as a fully static Next.js export for GitHub Pages.
- Plan generation, check-ins, and weekly summaries run in-browser and persist via local storage.
- Reminders are user-driven: an in-session browser nudge, a pre-filled `mailto:` email draft, or a downloadable `.ics` calendar file the user imports themselves.

## Maintainability structure

- Auth effects and login actions are isolated in `src/app/hooks/use-coach-auth.ts`.
- Planner state, persistence, and check-in actions are isolated in `src/app/hooks/use-coach-planner.ts`.
- Check-in persistence flows through `src/lib/checkin-store.ts` to support backend migration without UI rewrites.
- `src/app/page.tsx` now focuses on dashboard-only metrics and cycle-entry routing.
- Route pages `src/app/focus/page.tsx`, `src/app/execute/page.tsx`, and `src/app/review/page.tsx` provide a deeper step-by-step UX while reusing the same planner and auth hooks.
- Planner hydration and persistence helpers are centralized in `src/lib/planner-state.ts`.
- Planner session hydration and migration orchestration are centralized in `src/lib/planner-session.ts`.
- Planner-derived helper logic is centralized in `src/lib/planner-derivations.ts`.
- Reminder draft URL generation is centralized in `src/lib/reminder-draft.ts`.
- Check-in submission orchestration is centralized in `src/lib/checkin-workflow.ts`.
- Focus visual metadata is centralized in `src/lib/focus-metadata.ts` to keep route UI components declarative.
- Review analytics derivation logic is centralized in `src/lib/review-insights.ts` to keep the review route focused on rendering.
- Async operation state unions are centralized through `src/lib/async-status.ts` to reduce repeated status type definitions.

### Check-in backend mode

- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKIN_BACKEND` as `local` (default) or `firestore`.
- In `firestore` mode, the app uses Firestore when available and automatically falls back to local storage on backend errors.
- Firestore collection path is `users/{uid}/checkins`.
- On sign-in, guest check-ins are migrated to the signed-in scope once per backend mode with an idempotent migration marker.

### Stripe billing (Payment Link mode)

- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK` with a Stripe-hosted Payment Link URL for the $5/month membership; set it as the repository Variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK` so [.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) inlines it at build time.
- When set, the signed-in pricing CTA opens the Payment Link in a new tab with `client_reference_id=<firebase uid>` and `prefilled_email` appended, so payments are attributable with zero backend.
- When unset, the pricing CTA keeps the early-access mailto flow; both channels log `pricing_cta_clicked` with a channel detail for conversion analysis.
- Entitlement remains manual for now: after a payment, set `subscriptionStatus: "active"` on the matching `users/{uid}` Firestore document.
- Billing helpers and CTA behavior are covered in [src/lib/__tests__/billing.test.ts](src/lib/__tests__/billing.test.ts) and [src/app/__tests__/pricing-page-billing.test.tsx](src/app/__tests__/pricing-page-billing.test.tsx).

### Rust coaching bridge mode

- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_RUST_COACH_BRIDGE_URL` to enable optional Rust-powered coaching hints.
- When configured, planner flows call the bridge with JSON payloads compatible with `new-crate-project` stdin bridge semantics.
- If the bridge is unavailable or returns an error, calm-daily-coach automatically falls back to its local planner/check-in logic.
- GitHub Pages static deploy remains functional without this variable.

## Branch protection quality gate

- Workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, tests, and coverage on pushes and pull requests to `main`.
- Coverage HTML artifacts are uploaded on each workflow run.

## Configure Google auth

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable Authentication and turn on Google provider.
3. Add authorized domains:
	- localhost
	- rodmen07.github.io
4. Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env.local` and fill all NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE values.
5. Restart local dev server after env changes.

### OAuth troubleshooting checklist

If Google login fails on the live site, verify these first:

1. Firebase Authentication -> Sign-in method -> Google is enabled.
2. Firebase Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized domains includes `rodmen07.github.io`.
3. GitHub repository secrets for deploy workflow include all NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* values.
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` matches your Firebase project auth domain (usually `<project-id>.firebaseapp.com`).
5. Browser popup blockers are disabled for the live site.

The app now shows Firebase error codes/messages in UI to make production diagnosis faster.

## Reminders

Reminder preferences (opt-in, daily time, and channel) are configured from the dashboard `ReminderSettingsPanel` in [src/app/components/reminder-settings.tsx](src/app/components/reminder-settings.tsx) and persist per user scope via [src/lib/reminder-preferences.ts](src/lib/reminder-preferences.ts). Nothing is ever sent automatically; all three channels work on GitHub Pages with zero backend cost.

- Browser channel: an in-session nudge at the chosen time while the app is open (scheduling math in [src/lib/reminder-schedule.ts](src/lib/reminder-schedule.ts)).
- Email channel: opens a prefilled `mailto:` draft that the user sends themselves ([src/lib/reminder-draft.ts](src/lib/reminder-draft.ts)).
- Calendar channel: generates a `focus-daily-reminder.ics` file entirely in the browser ([src/lib/reminder-ics.ts](src/lib/reminder-ics.ts)) with a daily recurring event, a display alarm, and a stable UID so re-importing an updated file replaces the event in most calendar apps. The user imports the file into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook, and their calendar app does the reminding, even while Focus is closed. Event times are floating local times (no timezone id), so they ring at the chosen wall-clock time in most clients; Google Calendar pins floating times to the calendar's home timezone. After changing the reminder time, download and import a fresh file to replace the old event.

## API contracts

No server API routes in Pages mode.

## Persistence notes

- Check-ins are stored in browser local storage for zero-cost hosting.
- Data is device/browser specific until database-backed auth is added.
- The header sync badge in [src/app/components/sync-status-badge.tsx](src/app/components/sync-status-badge.tsx) reflects the actual check-in backend: `CLOUD SYNCED` only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKIN_BACKEND=firestore` resolves to a live Firestore, `SYNC OFF (LOCAL)` when Firestore mode is configured but unavailable, and `SIGNED IN (LOCAL)` when the deployment keeps data on-device.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to `main`.
2. Workflow [.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) builds and deploys automatically.
3. In repository settings, set Pages source to GitHub Actions if not already set.

## Dependabot updates

- This repository pins npm to the public registry in [.npmrc](.npmrc).
- Dependabot registry behavior is configured in [.github/dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml).
- These settings prevent private-registry resolution errors during npm security update runs.

## Next implementation steps

The canonical forward roadmap now lives in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) (as of 2026-07-18); the steps below are the earlier short list.

1. Replace local browser storage with Firestore sync per authenticated user.
2. Add time-based reminder scheduling through a backend worker.
3. Automate Stripe entitlement (webhook -> Firestore `subscriptionStatus`) on top of the shipped Payment Link checkout, then add paid trial gating.
